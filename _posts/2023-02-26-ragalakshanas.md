## Malahari

Māyamāḷavagowḷa, the fifteenth meḷa and the third rāga in the chakra Agni, is one among the few other  meḷas which have a large number of janya  rāgas to their credit. Malahari is one of them. The name Malahari literally means, that which removes impurity. It is a rāga ascribed to the rainy season. The dirt is removed from the atmosphere when the rain falls. In the same way rāga Malahari cleanses the mind from all evil thoughts and becomes free from all evil desires. Hence it is very appropriate that the first composition that the students learn after their preliminary swara exercises in Māyamāḷavagowḷa are the piḷḷāri gitās of Purandaradāsa in Malahari  rāga. 
The technical reason must have been that students will find it easier to learn their first composition in Malahari, as most of the notes are sung without gamaka. Being the janya of Māyamāḷavagowḷa, students are already familiar with the swarās.
Ma, Pa and Da are jiva swaras. Ma and Da are rāga chāya swarās. Ri and Dha are sometimes sung with a little gamaka, though Ri, Ma and Dha when sung plainly, reveal the individuality of the rāga. Ga is an alpa swara. It is sung as a plain note. Pa is the amsa swara. Ri, Ma and Pa are ryasa  swarās. 
Compositions begin on the notes Ri, Ma, Pa and Da. Examples, 
1. Ri – Padumanābha (r s d S S)
2. Ma – Srigaṇanātha (m p d ṡ ṡ ṙ)
3. Da – Kundagaura (d p m g r s), Kerayaniranu (d ṡ ṡ d p m p)
4. Pa – Panchamatanga (P d m p; d p m g r s)

**Note**:  Piḷḷāri gitās,  gitās meant for children or beginners of music. Piḷḷāri literally means children in Telugu. The name of the  rāga Malahari has undergone change like Malahara, Malahari, Malhār and Mallār. Regarding the practical use of the rāga, we should be grateful for Purandaradāsa (the Sangeeta Pitāmaha) who has composed the piḷḷāri gitās. It is a traditional habit in Hindu culture to get the blessings of Lord Vināyaka primarily for successful completion in all our ventures.  Purandaradāsa composed four gitās in Malahari, and the first is in the praise of Lord Gaṇapathi. The other three are on Sri Vishnu, Shiva and
